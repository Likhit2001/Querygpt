Learning and Testing Agent Functionality in LangChain and LangGraph

This project serves as a sandbox for exploring the internal mechanics and orchestration capabilities of AI agents using LangChain and LangGraph. The primary objective is to understand how agents process inputs, make decisions, call tools, and maintain state across multi-step reasoning chains or workflows.

Through this experimentation, I aim to:
	•	Gain hands-on experience with LangChain’s agent framework (e.g., ReAct, conversational agents, multi-tool agents).
	•	Build and visualize complex agent workflows using LangGraph, which enables graph-based routing of tasks between multiple nodes or agents.
	•	Test integration with external tools (e.g., APIs, function calls, custom toolkits) and memory components.
	•	Understand the execution lifecycle, step-by-step tool calling, and how data is passed and transformed through the agent pipeline.
	•	Experiment with persistent memory, intermediate state tracking, and agent-to-agent communication.
